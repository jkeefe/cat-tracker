# Process Notes on Cat-Tracker

This is my log and rough note-taking spot of how I'm going about this project.

## Concept

I want to play with machine learning, and I have an idea to play with data generated by my cat's location in my home.

## Getting the Pi Running

This time I'm trying the pi-management site [Resin.io](http://resin.io) to get my code on my pi, espcially since I hope to have three of these working to take measurements.

Following the instructions here: https://docs.resin.io/raspberrypi3/nodejs/getting-started/#adding-your-first-device

- Started new project: `cattracker`
- Downloaded image
- Using Etcher to put image on an SD card
- Now booting up the Pi -- ooh, this showed up in mere minutes


Instead of using [the example repo](https://github.com/resin-io-projects/simple-server-node), I made my own new repo.

- Synched it to resin with: `git remote add resin [me]@git.resin.io:j_f_keefe/cattracker.git`
- Then did `npm init`
- Then added, based on the example repo, but changing `server.js` to `index.js`: 
```
"scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
    "start": "node index.js"
  },
```
- Copied `Dockerfile.template` from [here](https://github.com/resin-io-projects/simple-server-node/blob/master/Dockerfile.template)
